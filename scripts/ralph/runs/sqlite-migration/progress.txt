# SQLite Migration Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

### Dexie Schema Versioning
- Current highest version: **16** (as of US-004)
- When adding a new version, MUST copy ALL table definitions - Dexie requires complete schema per version
- Compound indexes use `[field1+field2+field3]` syntax
- Always include `.upgrade(() => console.log(...))` function for debugging

### Performance Utilities
- Import `measureAsync` from `apps/store-app/src/utils` for function timing
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in test files are unrelated to this migration work

### N+1 Query Fix Pattern
When fixing N+1 patterns inside Promise.all loops:
1. Create interface for pre-fetched data (e.g., `PreFetchedTickets`)
2. Fetch all needed data ONCE before the loop with `Promise.all`
3. Pass pre-fetched data as parameter to inner functions
4. Convert async inner functions to sync when they no longer need DB access
5. Filter pre-fetched data in memory instead of making DB calls

### Result Caching Pattern
For expensive calculations that may be called repeatedly:
1. Create a cache class with `Map<string, { result: T; timestamp: number }>`
2. Use `undefined` return from `get()` to distinguish "not cached" from "cached null"
3. Generate deterministic cache keys (sort arrays before joining)
4. Invalidate by prefix (e.g., `storeId:`) to clear related entries without tracking exact keys
5. Export standalone `invalidateXxxCache(storeId)` function for external callers
6. Example: `apps/store-app/src/services/turnQueueCache.ts`

## Progress Entries

<!-- Ralph will append progress entries below this line -->

## 2026-01-16 - US-001: Add performance benchmarking utility
Commit: 0a49c99
- Created `apps/store-app/src/utils/performanceBenchmark.ts` with:
  - `measureAsync<T>()` - times async functions with optional threshold warnings
  - `measureSync<T>()` - times sync functions with optional threshold warnings
  - Uses `performance.now()` for high-resolution timing
  - Logs results with `[PERF]` prefix, warnings with `[PERF WARNING]`
- Created `apps/store-app/src/utils/index.ts` barrel export
- Fixed `packages/sqlite-adapter/package.json`: wa-sqlite peer dependency version `^0.9.0` -> `^1.0.0`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing typecheck errors in test files (AgendaView.test.tsx, staffSlice.test.ts, etc.) - these are unrelated to this migration
  - The `performance.ts` util file exists but is React-specific (hooks, memoization); `performanceBenchmark.ts` is for general function timing
  - No `utils/index.ts` existed previously - future utils can be added to this barrel
---

## 2026-01-16 - US-002: Create database abstraction interface
Commit: c356777
- Created `packages/sqlite-adapter/src/interfaces/DatabaseAdapter.ts` with:
  - `DatabaseAdapter<T>` interface: `findById`, `findMany`, `create`, `update`, `delete`
  - `QueryResult<T>` type: `{ data: T[]; total: number }`
  - `QueryOptions` type: `{ where?, orderBy?, limit?, offset? }`
  - All methods return Promises for consistency across Dexie/SQLite
- Created `packages/sqlite-adapter/src/interfaces/index.ts` barrel export
- Updated `packages/sqlite-adapter/src/index.ts` to export new interfaces
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing typecheck errors in sqlite-adapter package (adapters/, factory.ts) - unrelated to this work
  - The `types.ts` already has `PaginatedResult<T>` but `QueryResult<T>` was added for semantic clarity in the adapter interface
  - Used `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `Record<string, any>` for `where` clause to avoid forbidden `any`
---

## 2026-01-16 - US-003: Fix client filtering to use Dexie indexes
Commit: 9a962bf
- Modified `apps/store-app/src/db/database.ts`:
  - Imported `measureAsync` from `../utils` for performance tracking
  - Refactored `clientsDB.getFiltered()` to use Dexie `.filter()` on Collection instead of `.toArray().filter()`
  - Wrapped entire function with `measureAsync('clientsDB.getFiltered', ...)`
  - Dexie `.filter()` on Collection is more efficient - allows skipping non-matching items without full deserialization
  - Added `filteredCollection.count()` for efficient total counting before pagination
- **Performance improvement:**
  - Before: `collection.toArray()` → load ALL clients → JS `.filter()`
  - After: `collection.filter(filterFn)` → Dexie processes filter during iteration → only matching items fully materialized
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dexie's `.filter()` on Collection is different from JS Array `.filter()` - it's applied during cursor iteration
  - Still need `.toArray()` after filtering for sorting (Dexie doesn't support custom sort on filtered collections)
  - The `measureAsync` utility is now available via `import { measureAsync } from '../utils'`
---

## 2026-01-16 - US-004: Add missing compound indexes for tickets
Commit: a900084
- Added schema version 16 to `apps/store-app/src/db/schema.ts`:
  - New compound index `[storeId+status+createdAt]` for tickets - optimizes turn queue queries filtering by status and sorting by time
  - New compound index `[storeId+staffId+createdAt]` for tickets - optimizes staff performance queries for ticket counts per staff
  - Includes upgrade function with descriptive console.log
- All existing table definitions copied from version 15 (per critical note in PRD)
- **Performance improvement:**
  - These indexes enable efficient queries like "get all open tickets for store X sorted by creation time" without full table scan
  - Turn queue and staff aggregation queries can now use compound index seeks instead of loading all tickets
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dexie compound indexes use `[field1+field2+field3]` syntax
  - When adding new version, must copy ALL table definitions (not just changed ones) due to Dexie's versioning model
  - Pre-existing `as any` in initializeDatabase error handling (line 852) - this is acceptable for error type checking
---

## 2026-01-16 - US-005: Add helper method for staff ticket counts
Commit: d85db36
- Added `ticketsDB.getStaffTicketCounts(storeId, staffIds, since)` to `apps/store-app/src/db/database.ts`:
  - Returns `Map<string, number>` for O(1) staff count lookups
  - Fetches all tickets for store since given date in single query (uses `storeId` index)
  - Iterates `ticket.services` array to count services per staff
  - Initializes counts for all requested staffIds (returns 0 for staff with no tickets)
  - Wrapped with `measureAsync('ticketsDB.getStaffTicketCounts', ...)` for timing
  - Guard clause returns empty Map for invalid inputs
- **Performance improvement:**
  - Before: Each turn queue calculation called `ticketsDB.getAll()` per staff member (N+1 pattern)
  - After: Single batch query returns counts for all staff (O(1) lookup per staff)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Staff ID is in `ticket.services[].staffId`, not on the ticket directly
  - Use `Set<string>` for O(1) membership testing when filtering by staff IDs
  - Initialize Map with all requested keys to ensure consistent return structure

## 2026-01-16 - US-006: Fix turn queue N+1 - pre-fetch tickets
Commit: 28e29a9
- Eliminated N+1 query pattern in `apps/store-app/src/services/turnQueueService.ts`:
  - Added `PreFetchedTickets` interface to hold pre-fetched data (allTickets, activeTickets, twoHoursAgo)
  - `findBestStaff()` now fetches `ticketsDB.getAll()` and `ticketsDB.getActive()` once at the start
  - `scoreStaff()` changed from async to sync, now accepts `PreFetchedTickets` parameter
  - `calculateTurnScore()` uses pre-fetched tickets instead of calling `ticketsDB.getAll()`
  - `calculateLoadScore()` uses pre-fetched activeTickets instead of calling `ticketsDB.getActive()`
  - `getTurnQueueStats()` pre-fetches all data (staff, allTickets, activeTickets) before mapping
  - `suggestStaff()` pre-fetches data before scoring (same pattern as findBestStaff)
  - Wrapped `findBestStaff()` with `measureAsync('turnQueueService.findBestStaff', ...)`
  - Fixed lint issue: removed inferrable type annotation on `vipClient` parameter
- **Performance improvement:**
  - Before: 2 DB calls per staff member in findBestStaff (N+1 pattern)
  - After: 2 DB calls total regardless of staff count
  - For 10 staff members: 20+ queries → 2 queries (10x improvement)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - N+1 pattern often hidden inside Promise.all loops where each callback makes DB calls
  - Changing async methods to sync when they no longer need DB access improves performance
  - Pre-fetch pattern: fetch once before loop, pass data as parameter, filter in memory

## 2026-01-16 - US-007: Add turn queue result caching
Commit: e7780d5
- Created `apps/store-app/src/services/turnQueueCache.ts`:
  - `TurnQueueCache` class with private `Map<string, CacheEntry>` storage
  - `CacheEntry` interface: `{ result: Staff | null; timestamp: number }`
  - `get(key)`: Returns `Staff | null | undefined` - undefined if not cached or expired
  - `set(key, result)`: Stores result with current timestamp
  - `invalidate(storeId)`: Clears all entries for a store (prefix match on keys)
  - `clear()`: Clears entire cache (useful for testing)
  - `CACHE_TTL_MS = 30000` (30 second TTL constant)
  - Exported `invalidateTurnQueueCache(storeId)` function for external use
- Modified `apps/store-app/src/services/turnQueueService.ts`:
  - Added `generateCacheKey(storeId, criteria)` helper for deterministic cache keys
  - Cache key format: `storeId:serviceIds:vipClient:preferredStaffId:requiredSkills`
  - `findBestStaff()` checks cache before calculation, logs cache hits
  - Stores results in cache after calculation (including null for no available staff)
  - Re-exports `invalidateTurnQueueCache` for convenience
- **Performance improvement:**
  - Repeated turn queue requests with same criteria return instantly from cache
  - 30-second TTL balances freshness vs performance
  - Cache invalidation available for ticket/staff changes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cache keys should be deterministic - sort arrays in criteria before joining
  - Use `undefined` return to distinguish "not cached" from "cached null value"
  - Invalidate by prefix (storeId:) allows clearing all entries for a store without tracking exact keys

## 2026-01-16 - US-008: Fix performance metrics N+1 query pattern
Commit: 4914881
- Modified `apps/store-app/src/db/performanceOperations.ts`:
  - Replaced N+1 for-loop (lines 154-167) that queried previousVisits per clientId
  - New implementation uses single batch query with Supabase `.in('client_id', clientIdArray)`
  - Builds `Set<string>` of clients with previous visits from batch results
  - New clients = clientIds NOT in clientsWithPreviousVisits set
  - Wrapped `getStaffPerformanceMetrics()` with `measureAsync('performanceDB.getStaffPerformanceMetrics', ...)`
  - Added import for `measureAsync` from `@/utils`
- **Performance improvement:**
  - Before: N queries for N unique clients to check previous visits
  - After: 1 query fetches all previous visit records at once
  - For 50 unique clients: 50 queries → 1 query (50x improvement)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase `.in()` supports arrays efficiently for batch lookups
  - Build Set from results for O(1) membership testing
  - Pre-existing lint/typecheck errors in test files are unrelated to migration work

## 2026-01-17 - US-009: Implement better-sqlite3 Electron adapter
Commit: 19e4206
- Implemented `createElectronAdapter()` in `packages/sqlite-adapter/src/adapters/electron.ts`:
  - Uses `better-sqlite3` (peer dependency) for synchronous SQLite operations
  - All methods wrapped in Promise for SQLiteAdapter interface compatibility
  - `exec(sql)`: Run DDL statements without return value
  - `run(sql, params?)`: Execute with params, returns `{ changes, lastInsertRowid }`
  - `get<T>(sql, params?)`: Fetch single row or undefined
  - `all<T>(sql, params?)`: Fetch all rows as array
  - `transaction<T>(fn)`: Async transaction with manual BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
  - `close()`: Close database connection
  - Extended `ElectronSQLiteConfig` interface with `dbPath` property
  - Defaults to `'mango.db'` if no dbPath or dbName provided
  - WAL mode and foreign keys enabled by default (configurable)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - better-sqlite3 is sync - wrap with `Promise.resolve().then(() => ...)` for interface compatibility
  - For transactions with async callbacks, use manual BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK (not db.transaction())
  - Peer dependency pattern allows adapter package to work without installing unused drivers
  - Pre-existing typecheck errors in other adapters (capacitor.ts, web.ts, factory.ts) are unrelated to this work
