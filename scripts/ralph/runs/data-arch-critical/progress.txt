## Codebase Patterns (READ FIRST)

### dataService Pattern
The dataService is located at `apps/store-app/src/services/dataService.ts`
All data access in components should go through dataService, not direct DB imports.

### Adapter Pattern
Type adapters convert between Supabase snake_case and app camelCase.
Location: `apps/store-app/src/services/supabase/adapters/`
Example: appointmentAdapter.ts has toAppointment(), toAppointmentInsert(), etc.

### Redux Pattern
Team data: Use `fetchTeamMembers()` from `store/slices/team/teamThunks.ts`
Client data: Use dataService.clients or Redux selectors from clientsSlice

### Import Restrictions
BAD: `import { clientsDB } from '@/db/database'`
GOOD: `import { dataService } from '@/services/dataService'`
