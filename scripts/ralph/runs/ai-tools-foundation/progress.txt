# AI Tools Foundation - Ralph Session Progress

## Session Info
- Branch: ralph/ai-tools-foundation
- Created: 2026-01-29
- Agent: Claude Code (not AMP)
- Purpose: Make Mango Biz AI-controllable for Mango Connect integration

## Vision
"Make Mango Biz a house AI loves to live in"
- AI can see everything (comprehensive tool schemas)
- AI can do anything (every operation exposed)
- AI can understand context (rich metadata, clear descriptions)
- AI can react instantly (MQTT events)
- AI doesn't get confused (predictable patterns)

## Stories Summary
- Total: 18 stories
- Priority 1 (Foundation): US-001, US-002 (2 stories)
- Priority 2 (Schemas): US-003 through US-007, US-010 (6 stories)
- Priority 3 (Handlers): US-008, US-009, US-011, US-012, US-013 (5 stories)
- Priority 4 (Integration): US-014, US-015, US-016 (3 stories)

## Categories
- Infrastructure: 3 stories (package setup, types, registry)
- Tools (Schemas): 7 stories (clients, appointments, services, tickets, staff, analytics, system)
- Handlers: 3 stories (implement actual tool execution)
- Backend: 1 story (edge function)
- Database: 1 story (audit table)
- Documentation: 3 stories (catalog, guide, MQTT events)
- Testing: 1 story

## Estimated Complexity
- Simple (1-2): 4 stories
- Medium (3): 7 stories
- Complex (4): 4 stories

2. 40+ tool schemas covering all business operations
3. Handlers connecting tools to dataService
4. Edge function endpoint for Mango Connect to call
5. Audit logging for all AI operations
6. Comprehensive documentation

## 2026-01-29 - US-001: Initialize packages/ai-tools package structure
Commit: b7ae2e78

**Why this story?** Foundation story with no dependencies, highest priority (1), and all other schema stories depend on it.

**Changes:**
- `packages/ai-tools/package.json (NEW)`: Created @mango/ai-tools package with zod, zod-to-json-schema deps and peer deps for @mango/types, @mango/api-contracts
- `packages/ai-tools/tsconfig.json (NEW)`: Extends ../../tooling/tsconfig/base.json following existing package patterns
- `packages/ai-tools/src/index.ts (NEW)`: Placeholder exports with AI_TOOLS_VERSION, AIToolCategory type, SUPPORTED_CATEGORIES constant
- `packages/ai-tools/README.md (NEW)`: Documents purpose for Mango Connect integration with quick start and category overview

**Learnings:**
- PRD noted "extends ../../tsconfig.base.json" but that path doesn't exist. Followed existing package pattern (packages/types) using "../../tooling/tsconfig/base.json"
- electron-builder postinstall failure is pre-existing issue unrelated to ai-tools package
- Package uses workspace:* protocol for peer dependencies following existing monorepo patterns

**Next story suggestion:** US-002 (Create base tool types and schema converter) - it's the direct dependency for all schema stories (US-003 through US-008)
