# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-19
Branch: ralph/foundation-tech-debt
PRD: Foundation & Technical Debt (Phase 1 & 2)

## Overview

This run implements the Foundation Fixes (Phase 1) and Technical Debt (Phase 2) plan:

**Phase 1 - Foundation Fixes:**
- US-001, US-002: Vitest coverage config updates
- US-003 to US-006: Fix 4 silent error failures in featureFlags.ts
- US-007: Add console removal plugin
- US-008 to US-014: PaymentModal real tests
- US-015 to US-018: Verify/complete TicketPanel modularization

**Phase 2 - Technical Debt:**
- US-019 to US-026: Extract dataService.ts into domain services
- US-027 to US-029: Split AddTeamMember.tsx
- US-030, US-031: Split PaymentModal.tsx
- US-032 to US-034: Split OperationTemplateSetup.tsx
- US-035 to US-037: Split TimesheetSection.tsx

## Setup Information

**PRD Document:** `/tasks/prd-foundation-tech-debt.md`
**PRD JSON:** `scripts/ralph/runs/foundation-tech-debt/prd.json`
**Total Stories:** 37

### Key File Sizes (Before)

| File | Lines | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| dataService.ts | 3,090 | <500 |
| TicketPanel.tsx | 1,668 | Already partially modularized |
| AddTeamMember.tsx | 1,516 | <500 |
| OperationTemplateSetup.tsx | 1,380 | <500 |
| TimesheetSection.tsx | 1,187 | <500 |
| PaymentModal.tsx | 1,154 | <500 |
| featureFlags.ts | 345 | ~360 (add logging) |
| vitest.config.ts | 59 | ~70 |
| PaymentModal.test.tsx | 70 | ~200 (real tests) |

### Existing Checkout Modularization

TicketPanel already has partial module structure:
- `hooks/` - 11 files (useTicketKeyboard.ts, useTicketPersistence.ts, etc.)
- `components/` - 9 files (CatalogPanel.tsx, TicketHeader.tsx, etc.)
- `reducers/` - ticketReducer.ts
- `constants/` - exists

US-015 to US-018 are verification stories to audit completeness.

### Empty Catch Blocks in featureFlags.ts

Located at lines:
- ~92: getFeatureFlag
- ~250: getNumericFeatureFlag
- ~264: getJsonFeatureFlag
- ~278: getArrayFeatureFlag

## 2026-01-19 - US-001: Add checkout, auth, and common paths to Vitest coverage
Commit: ede3706

**Why this story?** US-001 is the highest priority story with no dependencies. It's a prerequisite for US-002 (coverage thresholds).

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/vitest.config.ts:22-26`: Added three glob patterns to coverage include array:
  - `src/components/checkout/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
  - `src/components/auth/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
  - `src/components/common/**/*.{ts,tsx}`

**Learnings:**
- Changes were already present in working directory (uncommitted) - verified and committed
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors exist across the codebase (test files, uiTicketsSlice.ts, types/index.ts) - these are NOT related to US-001 and should be addressed separately
- The typecheck criterion in PRD may need adjustment since pre-existing errors block all stories

**Next story suggestion:** US-002 (Add coverage thresholds) since US-001 is now complete and US-002 depends on it. Same file, same category, fresh in context.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-002: Add coverage thresholds to Vitest config
Commit: a628f67

**Why this story?** US-002 has dependency on US-001 (now complete), same file (vitest.config.ts), same category (test), and lowest priority among available stories with satisfied dependencies.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/vitest.config.ts:39-44`: Added coverage thresholds object:
  - `statements: 50`
  - `branches: 40`
  - `functions: 50`
  - `lines: 50`

**Learnings:**
- Changes were already present in working directory (uncommitted from previous session) - verified against acceptance criteria and committed
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in test files persist (Book/__tests__/*.tsx) - these are unrelated to US-002 and affect the "typecheck passes" criterion for all stories
- The PRD's "typecheck passes" acceptance criteria should be interpreted as "no NEW typecheck errors introduced by this story" since pre-existing errors exist

**Next story suggestion:** US-003 (Fix silent error in featureFlags getFeatureFlag) - next available priority, no dependencies, different file so a clean context switch.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-003: Fix silent error in featureFlags isInRollbackState
Commit: eb4dba3

**Why this story?** US-003 is the highest priority story with no dependencies among remaining stories. It starts the pattern for US-004 to US-006 which all work on the same file.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/config/featureFlags.ts:92-94`: Changed empty catch block to log errors:
  - Before: `} catch { return false; }`
  - After: `} catch (error) { console.warn('[FeatureFlags] Failed to parse rollback state:', error); return false; }`

**Learnings:**
- PRD notes referenced `getFeatureFlag` function at line ~92, but actual function is `isInRollbackState()`. PRD function names are outdated but the intent (add logging to silent catch blocks) is clear and correct.
- The four functions named in US-003 to US-006 (`getFeatureFlag`, `getNumericFeatureFlag`, `getJsonFeatureFlag`, `getArrayFeatureFlag`) don't exist in featureFlags.ts. The actual functions with empty catch blocks are:
  - `isInRollbackState()` (~line 92) - US-003
  - `getCachedMigrationStatus()` (~line 250) - US-004
  - `cacheMigrationStatus()` (~line 264) - US-005
  - `clearCachedMigrationStatus()` (~line 278) - US-006
- featureFlagService.ts is a separate file with different feature flag functions

**Patterns to sync:** None - this is standard error logging best practice

**Next story suggestion:** US-004 (Fix silent error in getCachedMigrationStatus) - same file, same pattern, code is fresh in context.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-004: Fix silent error in featureFlags getCachedMigrationStatus
Commit: cbd8e53

**Why this story?** US-004 is the next priority after US-003, same file (featureFlags.ts), same pattern (adding error logging to silent catch blocks). Code structure is fresh in context from previous story.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/config/featureFlags.ts:251-253`: Changed empty catch block to log errors:
  - Before: `} catch { return null; }`
  - After: `} catch (error) { console.warn('[FeatureFlags] Failed to parse cached migration status:', error); return null; }`

**Learnings:**
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors continue to exist in test files and type files (not from this change)
- featureFlags.ts itself has no TypeScript errors - verified with `grep -i featureFlags` on typecheck output
- Pre-existing test failures in integration tests (e.g., padCheckoutFlow.test.ts, WaitListItem.test.tsx) - these are unrelated to featureFlags.ts changes

**Next story suggestion:** US-005 (Fix silent error in cacheMigrationStatus) - same file, same pattern, line ~265.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-005: Fix silent error in featureFlags cacheMigrationStatus
Commit: 741ca53

**Why this story?** US-005 is the next priority after US-004, same file (featureFlags.ts), same pattern (adding error logging to silent catch blocks). Code structure is fresh in context from previous story.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/config/featureFlags.ts:266-267`: Changed empty catch block to log errors:
  - Before: `} catch { // Ignore localStorage errors }`
  - After: `} catch (error) { console.warn('[FeatureFlags] Failed to cache migration status:', error); }`

**Learnings:**
- PRD title says "getJsonFeatureFlag" but the actual function is `cacheMigrationStatus()`. Intent is correct (add logging to silent catch blocks).
- The function doesn't return a value (void), so we just log without changing return behavior.
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors (Book/__tests__/*.tsx) and test failures (6 test files, 116 failed tests) continue to exist - these are unrelated to featureFlags.ts changes.

**Next story suggestion:** US-006 (Fix silent error in clearCachedMigrationStatus) - same file, same pattern, line ~280.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-006: Fix silent error in featureFlags clearCachedMigrationStatus
Commit: d584d2f

**Why this story?** US-006 is the highest priority incomplete story with no dependencies. It completes the pattern established in US-003 to US-005 (adding error logging to silent catch blocks in featureFlags.ts). Same file, code structure is fresh in context.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/config/featureFlags.ts:280-282`: Changed empty catch block to log errors:
  - Before: `} catch { // Ignore localStorage errors }`
  - After: `} catch (error) { console.warn('[FeatureFlags] Failed to clear cached migration status:', error); }`

**Learnings:**
- PRD title says "getArrayFeatureFlag" but the actual function is `clearCachedMigrationStatus()`. Intent is correct (add logging to silent catch blocks).
- This completes all 4 silent catch block fixes in featureFlags.ts (US-003 to US-006).
- The function doesn't return a value (void), so we just log without changing return behavior.
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors (Book/__tests__/*.tsx) and test failures (6 test files, 116 failed tests) continue to exist - these are unrelated to featureFlags.ts changes.

**Next story suggestion:** US-007 (Add vite-plugin-remove-console for production builds) - next available priority with no dependencies. Different file (vite.config.ts), different category (build), logical progression from foundation fixes to build improvements.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-007: Add console removal for production builds
Commit: 383ca0c

**Why this story?** US-007 is the highest priority incomplete story with no dependencies. It's a build optimization task that follows the pattern of foundation fixes.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/vite.config.ts:6-14`: Changed from static config to dynamic config function with esbuild pure option:
  - Before: `export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react(), /* disabled removeConsole */] })`
  - After: `export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({ plugins: [react()], esbuild: { pure: mode === 'production' ? ['console.log', 'console.debug'] : [] } }))`
- Removed commented-out vite-plugin-remove-console references (lines 3-5, 12-13)
- Added closing parenthesis for arrow function return (line 87)

**Implementation Note:**
Used esbuild's native `pure` option instead of vite-plugin-remove-console because:
- vite-plugin-remove-console has JSX parsing issues (documented in original comments)
- The plugin fails with error "Expression expected" when console.log is inside JSX onClick handlers
- esbuild `pure` is built-in, faster, and handles 99% of console.log removal needs
- The `pure` option correctly removes standalone console.log/debug while preserving console.warn/error

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run build` passes successfully (12.97s)
- Verified "API Request" log message (standalone console.log in client.ts) is NOT in production build
- console.warn instances ARE present in build (confirmed preservation)
- 4 remaining console.log in build are: vendor libs (supabase) and placeholder onClick handlers (edge case)

**Learnings:**
- vite-plugin-remove-console uses regex-based removal which breaks on JSX constructs like `onClick={() => console.log(...)}`
- esbuild `pure` marks functions as side-effect-free, allowing dead code elimination when return value is unused
- For 100% removal of console.log inside callbacks, would need different approach (babel plugin or terser)
- The PRD's approach was technically correct but the plugin has known issues - adapt and document

**Patterns to sync:**
- Pattern: Use esbuild `pure` option for console removal in Vite instead of plugins that have parsing issues

**Next story suggestion:** US-008 (Implement PaymentModal test - renders when open) - next available priority with no dependencies. Different category (test), starts the PaymentModal test implementation series.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-008: Implement PaymentModal test - renders when open
Commit: c39f873

**Why this story?** US-008 is the highest priority incomplete story with no dependencies. It starts the PaymentModal test implementation series (US-008 to US-014). Previous story (US-007) suggested this as the logical next step.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:1-141`: Replaced placeholder tests with real assertions:
  - Added proper imports (vitest, testing-library, react-redux, configureStore)
  - Created mocks for Dialog, tooltip, payment services, and pad components
  - Created mock Redux store with auth, padTransaction, and uiTickets state
  - Created renderWithProvider helper function
  - Implemented 'should render when open is true' test with assertions for dialog and title
  - Implemented 'should not render when open is false' test

**Learnings:**
- PaymentModal uses `open` prop (not `isOpen` as noted in PRD) - actual component API differs from PRD description
- PaymentModal requires Redux store with:
  - `auth.store.storeId`, `auth.member.memberId`, `auth.device.id`
  - `padTransaction.activeTransaction`, `padTransaction.customerStarted`
  - `uiTickets.pendingTickets` (array) - used by `selectUnresolvedPriceChanges` selector
- Testing approach: Mock Radix UI Dialog component to control visibility based on `open` prop
- Pre-existing test failures (118 tests) in codebase are unrelated to PaymentModal changes

**Patterns to sync:** None - standard React testing patterns with Redux Provider

**Next story suggestion:** US-009 (Implement PaymentModal test - does not render when closed) - same file, depends on US-008 (now complete), lower complexity. The test infrastructure is already set up.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-009: Implement PaymentModal test - does not render when closed
Commit: c39f873 (part of US-008)

**Why this story?** US-009 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-008 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context.

**Changes:**
- No code changes needed - test was already implemented as part of US-008 commit (c39f873)
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:135-140`: Test 'should not render when open is false' already has real assertions

**Verification:**
- Test renders PaymentModal with `open={false}` ✓
- Uses `queryByTestId` (returns null if not found) ✓
- Asserts modal container is NOT in the document ✓
- Test passes: All 10 PaymentModal tests pass ✓
- TypeScript: Pre-existing errors only, no new errors ✓

**Learnings:**
- Previous iteration (US-008) implemented both the "renders when open" and "does not render when closed" tests together
- PRD split these into separate stories but the natural implementation pattern covered both cases in one commit
- This is acceptable - the test meets all acceptance criteria regardless of when it was written

**Next story suggestion:** US-010 (Implement PaymentModal test - displays payment method options) - same file, depends on US-008 (complete), next in the PaymentModal test series.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-010: Implement PaymentModal test - displays payment method options
Commit: 0ea2975

**Why this story?** US-010 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-008 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context from US-008/US-009 work.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:7-8`: Added imports for `fireEvent` and `act` from testing-library
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:143-164`: Replaced placeholder test with real assertions:
  - Added `async` to test function for proper act() handling
  - Click "Continue to Payment" button to navigate to step 2 where payment methods are shown
  - Used `act()` wrapper around `fireEvent.click()` to properly handle React state updates
  - Assert all 4 payment method cards are visible via data-testid
  - Assert payment method labels are visible (Credit Card, Cash, Gift Card, Other)

**Learnings:**
- PaymentModal uses a multi-step flow: Step 1 is "Add Tip", Step 2 shows payment methods
- Must navigate to step 2 by clicking "Continue to Payment" button before payment methods are rendered
- React state updates in tests need to be wrapped in `act()` to avoid warnings and ensure DOM updates complete
- Payment methods are defined in `PAYMENT_METHODS` array at line 433-438 with ids: card, cash, gift_card, custom
- Each payment method card has data-testid format `card-payment-method-{id}`

**Next story suggestion:** US-011 (Implement PaymentModal test - handles close callback) - same file, depends on US-008 (complete), tests user interaction with close functionality.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-011: Implement PaymentModal test - handles close callback
Commit: bbb0fa9

**Why this story?** US-011 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-008 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context from US-008/US-009/US-010 work.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:14-40`: Updated Dialog mock to include `onOpenChange` prop and a close button that triggers `onOpenChange(false)` when clicked
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:155-171`: Added new 'closing' describe block with test for onClose callback:
  - Creates mock onClose function with `vi.fn()`
  - Renders PaymentModal with mock onClose
  - Finds and clicks the dialog close button
  - Asserts onClose was called exactly once

**Learnings:**
- PaymentModal passes `onClose` to the Dialog component via `onOpenChange={onClose}` (line 475)
- There's no explicit "Cancel" button in the component - closing happens through Radix UI Dialog mechanisms
- To test close functionality, needed to enhance the Dialog mock to simulate the onOpenChange callback trigger
- Standard pattern: Mock Dialog with close button that calls `onOpenChange?.(false)` to simulate closing

**Next story suggestion:** US-012 (Implement PaymentModal test - handles payment selection) - same file, depends on US-010 (complete), tests payment method selection interaction.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-012: Implement PaymentModal test - handles payment selection
Commit: 4e52b41

**Why this story?** US-012 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-010 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context from previous PaymentModal tests.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:197-225`: Replaced placeholder test with real assertions:
  - Navigate to step 2 (Payment) by clicking "Continue to Payment" button
  - Click on the Cash payment method card
  - Assert Cash payment section appears (input for cash received)
  - Click on Credit Card payment method
  - Assert Card payment section appears (Apply button)
  - Assert Cash input is no longer visible (confirms state change)

**Learnings:**
- Payment method selection is handled by `handleSelectMethod` function (line 440-444) which sets `currentMethod` state
- Each payment method type renders different UI when selected:
  - `card`: Shows "Apply ${amount}" button (`button-apply-card`)
  - `cash`: Shows cash received input and quick amount buttons (`input-cash-received`)
  - `gift_card`: Shows "Enter Gift Card Code" button (`button-enter-gift-card`)
  - `custom`: Shows payment name input and apply button (`input-custom-payment-name`, `button-apply-custom`)
- The selected method's UI section replaces the previous one - only one is shown at a time
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in Book/__tests__/*.tsx files are unrelated to PaymentModal changes

**Next story suggestion:** US-013 (Implement PaymentModal test - displays correct totals) - same file, depends on US-008 (complete), tests total display calculations.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-013: Implement PaymentModal test - displays correct totals
Commit: 9e93efe

**Why this story?** US-013 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-008 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context from previous PaymentModal tests.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:231-300`: Added new 'totals display' describe block with real tests:
  - `should display correct totals on tip step`: Tests service total ($100) and total with tip ($120 = $100 + 20% default tip) are displayed correctly
  - `should update total when tip percentage changes`: Tests clicking 15% tip button changes total from $120 to $115
  - `should show zero tip when no tip is selected`: Tests "No Tip" button results in service total = total with tip
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:302-358`: Replaced placeholder tip handling tests with real implementations:
  - `should show tip options`: Verifies tip percentage buttons and custom tip input are visible
  - `should calculate tip based on percentage`: Tests 25% of $50 = $12.50, total = $62.50
  - `should show tip distribution preview`: Tests auto-distribute with multiple staff (30/70 split on $20 tip = $6/$14)

**Learnings:**
- PaymentModal Step 1 displays "Service total" and "Your total (with tip)" cards
- Default tip percentage is 20% (initialized in useState at line 172)
- Tip options include 15%, 18%, 20%, 25% and a "No Tip" button
- Tip distribution is only shown when `staffMembers.length > 1 && tipAmount > 0` (line 566)
- Auto-distribute calculates tip proportionally based on each staff member's `serviceTotal`
- The component uses data-testid attributes for all interactive elements (button-tip-{percentage}, input-custom-tip, etc.)

**Next story suggestion:** US-014 (Implement PaymentModal test - handles payment completion) - same file, depends on US-012 (complete), completes the PaymentModal test series.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-014: Implement PaymentModal test - handles payment completion
Commit: 19fffc3

**Why this story?** US-014 is the highest priority incomplete story with satisfied dependencies (US-012 complete). Same file (PaymentModal.test.tsx), same category (test), code structure fresh in context from previous PaymentModal tests. It completes the PaymentModal test implementation series.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/__tests__/PaymentModal.test.tsx:360-449`: Added new 'payment completion' describe block with two real tests:
  - `should handle payment completion with expected data`: Tests the full payment flow - navigates to step 2, selects cash payment, enters $60 (covers $50 + 20% tip), applies payment, and verifies `onComplete` is called with correct data structure including payment methods array and tip amount
  - `should include tip distribution when multiple staff members are present`: Tests payment completion with multiple staff members, sets up auto-distribute tip, completes payment, and verifies `onComplete` includes tipDistribution array with correct proportional amounts (60/40 split on $20 tip = $12/$8)

**Learnings:**
- PaymentModal's `onComplete` callback (prop name is `onComplete`, not `onPaymentComplete` as PRD suggested) receives an object with:
  - `methods`: Array of PaymentMethod objects with type, amount, and optional tendered/customName
  - `tip`: Number representing the tip amount
  - `tipDistribution`: Optional array of TipDistribution objects when tip is distributed among multiple staff
  - `padTransactionId`: Optional string when payment was sent to Mango Pad
- Payment completion is triggered automatically via useEffect when `isFullyPaid && currentStep === 2` with an 800ms delay for success animation
- Testing async completion requires `await act()` with setTimeout to wait for the 800ms delay to complete
- Cash payment captures both the `tendered` amount and the actual `amount` applied (which may differ if change is given)

**Next story suggestion:** US-015 (Extract TicketPanel types to types.ts) - next available priority with no dependencies. Starts the TicketPanel refactoring verification series (US-015 to US-018). Different category (refactor), different file, logical progression from test completion to code organization.

---

## 2026-01-19 - US-015: Extract TicketPanel types to types.ts
Commit: d9c68c2

**Why this story?** US-015 is the highest priority incomplete story with no dependencies among remaining stories (priority 15). It starts the TicketPanel modularization verification series (US-015 to US-018). Previous iteration suggested this as the logical next step.

**Changes:**
- No code changes required - verification only
- Types already extracted to `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/types/index.ts` (163 lines)
- TicketPanel.tsx already imports from `./types` at line 74: `import type { PanelMode } from "./types";`
- Re-exports CouponData and GiftCardData at line 126-127

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ types.ts exists: `apps/store-app/src/components/checkout/types/index.ts` with comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ TicketPanel.tsx imports from './types': Line 74 imports PanelMode
- ✅ No duplicate type definitions: Only TicketPanelProps interface (component props) defined locally - appropriate
- ✅ No forbidden strings ('as any', 'void _') in TicketPanel.tsx
- ⚠️ TypeScript: Pre-existing errors in Book/__tests__/*.tsx test files (unrelated to TicketPanel types)

**Types Extracted Include:**
- CouponData, GiftCardData - Coupon and gift card data structures
- DiscountState, StaffState, DialogState, UIState - State interfaces
- PanelMode ("dock" | "full") - Panel display mode
- DialogKey - Union type for dialog toggle keys
- TicketState - Complete ticket state interface
- TicketAction - Action union type for reducer
- UndoSnapshot - Undo state snapshot interface

**Learnings:**
- TicketPanel types were already extracted in a previous iteration - PRD notes may not reflect current state
- The types folder uses `types/index.ts` convention (not `types.ts`), which is proper for a folder-based module
- Always verify current state before implementing - work may already be complete
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors (Book/__tests__/*.tsx) exist but are unrelated to TicketPanel changes

**Next story suggestion:** US-016 (Extract TicketPanel constants to constants.ts) - depends on US-015 (now complete), same category (refactor), continues the TicketPanel modularization verification series.
