## Codebase Patterns

### Pre-existing TypeScript Errors
The codebase has pre-existing TypeScript errors in `smartAutoAssign.test.ts` (Date vs string type mismatches). These don't block test execution since Vitest runs without type checking.

### markTicketAsPaid.fulfilled Test Pattern
```typescript
store.dispatch({
  type: markTicketAsPaid.fulfilled.type,
  payload: {
    ticketId: 'ticket-id',
    ticket: mockTicket,
    sourceArray: 'waitlist' | 'in-service' | 'pending',
    paymentMethod: 'credit-card' | 'cash',
    tip: 0,
    transaction: { id: 'txn-id' },
  },
});
```

## Iteration Log

## 2026-01-17 - US-002: Add markTicketAsPaid.fulfilled reducer tests for serviceTickets source
Commit: ae4a18a4bfdedc42f9dc909a31d5d3db4e3a257e

**Why this story?** US-001 was already implemented from a previous iteration. US-002 is the next highest priority and builds directly on the same describe block, making it the logical next step.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/store/slices/__tests__/uiTicketsSlice.test.ts:477-513`: Added test 'should remove ticket from serviceTickets when sourceArray is in-service'

**Learnings:**
- US-001 was already implemented but not marked as passes: true in the PRD - always verify PRD vs code reality
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in smartAutoAssign.test.ts don't block test runs
- The reducer correctly handles 'in-service' sourceArray by removing from serviceTickets and adding to completedTickets

**Next story suggestion:** US-003 (pendingTickets source test) - continues the same pattern in the same file with minimal context switching
