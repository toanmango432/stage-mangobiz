## 2026-01-17 - US-001: Add PriceSource type for tracking price origin
Commit: (Pre-existing implementation found)

**Why this story?** US-001 has the highest priority (1), no dependencies, and is the foundation for price tracking types.

**Changes:**
- `apps/store-app/src/types/appointment.ts:27-33`: PriceSource type already implemented with full JSDoc documentation

**Learnings:**
- Implementation was already present in the codebase - marked as passes: true
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in test files (AgendaView.test.tsx, AppointmentCard.test.tsx) are unrelated to this story
- Test mocks have incomplete AppointmentService data (missing staffId, staffName)

**Next story suggestion:** US-002 (Add price snapshot fields to AppointmentService) - same file, direct dependency on US-001
