# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-14
Branch: ralph/frontdesk-fixes
Purpose: Fix critical issues from previous Ralph run (mock data, unused selectors, incomplete handlers)

## Pre-Run Notes

**Issues to fix from previous run (ralph/frontdesk-update):**
1. Mock data in production code (StaffSidebar lines 791-813)
2. Redux selectors imported but never used
3. Modal callbacks not implemented
4. Unused variables suppressed with void statements
5. Type safety violations (as any casts)
6. Large file (902 lines) needs splitting

**Quality checklist added to prompt.md - follow it for EVERY story.**
