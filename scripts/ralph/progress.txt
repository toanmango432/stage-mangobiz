## Codebase Patterns

See patterns.md for accumulated patterns from previous runs.

**Front Desk Module Patterns:**
- StaffCardVertical is the shared component for mobile/desktop staff display
- frontDeskSettingsSlice controls all Front Desk settings (view modes, sorting, drag-drop)
- urgencyUtils.ts contains threshold configs and color mappings
- Use design tokens from @/design-system for all colors
- Ticket cards use ServiceTicketCard and variants (WaitListTicketCard, PendingTicketCard)
- Section headers use CollapsibleSection pattern with count badges

<!-- Ralph appends entries below -->

## 2026-01-13 22:59 - US-001: Connect StaffCard displayConfig to FrontDeskSettings
Commit: ae9347b
- Added imports for useAppSelector and selectFrontDeskSettings from Redux
- StaffSidebar now reads settings from Redux frontDeskSettingsSlice
- Connected displayConfig to FrontDeskSettings: showTurnCount, showNextAppointment, showServicedAmount, showTicketCount, showLastDone
- Redux settings take priority, prop settings as fallback for backwards compatibility
- Files changed: apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - StaffSidebar has TWO settings systems: TeamSettingsPanel (localStorage) and FrontDeskSettings (Redux)
  - FrontDeskSettings is the main settings panel accessed via More > Front Desk Layout
  - TeamSettingsPanel is a legacy local settings (accessed via gear icon in Team section header)
  - Redux settings should be the single source of truth for card display options

## 2026-01-13 23:15 - US-002: Add More Options dropdown menu to StaffCard
Commit: 0413b05
- Added action settings to DisplayConfig interface: showMoreOptionsButton, showAddTicketAction, showAddNoteAction, showEditTeamAction, showQuickCheckoutAction
- Added action callbacks to StaffCardVerticalProps: onAddTicket, onAddNote, onEditTeam, onQuickCheckout
- Implemented DropdownMenu using Radix UI components from @/components/ui/dropdown-menu
- Menu items respect displayConfig settings (conditional rendering)
- Quick Checkout only visible when staff is busy and has activeTicket
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/StaffCard/hooks/useStaffCardDisplay.ts
  - apps/store-app/src/components/StaffCard/StaffCardVertical.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use existing DropdownMenu component from @/components/ui/dropdown-menu (shadcn/radix wrapper)
  - DisplayConfig interface in useStaffCardDisplay.ts is the central config for StaffCard display options
  - Action settings from FrontDeskSettingsData should map to DisplayConfig for consistency
  - Callbacks use staffId parameter so parent component can identify which staff triggered the action

## 2026-01-13 23:45 - US-003: Implement Add Ticket action on staff cards
Commit: 365a845
- Added useTicketPanel hook import to StaffSidebar for ticket creation flow
- Created handleAddTicket callback that opens ticket panel with staff pre-selected
- Passes techId and technician name to openTicketWithData for pre-selection
- Connected action settings (showAddTicketAction, showAddNoteAction, etc.) from FrontDeskSettings to displayConfig
- Passed onAddTicket callback to StaffCardVertical component
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useTicketPanel provides openTicketWithData(ticket) to open ticket panel with pre-filled data
  - TicketData interface includes techId and technician fields for staff pre-selection
  - Staff IDs may be strings or numbers - need to handle both when finding staff member
  - Action settings from FrontDeskSettings are passed through displayConfig to StaffCardVertical
---

## 2026-01-13 - US-004: Implement Add Note action on staff cards
Commit: 5fac7c6
- Created AddStaffNoteModal component for staff-specific notes (apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/AddStaffNoteModal.tsx)
- Added state management for staff note modal in StaffSidebar: showStaffNoteModal, selectedStaffForNote
- Created handleAddNote callback that finds staff member and opens note modal
- Created handleSaveStaffNote callback (placeholder for API integration)
- Passed onAddNote callback to StaffCardVertical component
- Modal uses teal color scheme to match Team Section styling
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/AddStaffNoteModal.tsx (new)
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing AddNoteModal is for tickets (requires ticketId, ticketNumber, clientName)
  - Created separate AddStaffNoteModal for staff notes to avoid coupling
  - Staff notes need their own storage/API integration (TODO in handleSaveStaffNote)
  - Use selectedStaffForNote state to track which staff member the modal is for
---

## 2026-01-13 - US-005: Implement Edit Team Member action on staff cards
Commit: 96528c3
- Added useAppDispatch hook import to StaffSidebar for Redux dispatch
- Added setSelectedMember import from teamSlice for pre-selecting team member
- Created handleEditTeam callback that:
  1. Finds staff member by numeric ID (handles string/number ID conversion)
  2. Pre-selects the staff member in Redux teamSlice using setSelectedMember
  3. Navigates to team-settings module via custom event (navigate-to-module)
- Passed onEditTeam callback to StaffCardVertical component
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AppShell listens for 'navigate-to-module' custom events to switch modules
  - UIStaff.id is already the team member UUID string (from TeamMemberSettings.id)
  - teamSlice's setSelectedMember expects a string ID matching TeamMemberSettings.id
  - Navigation pattern: dispatch Redux action first, then trigger module navigation event
---

## 2026-01-13 - US-006: Implement Quick Checkout action on staff cards
Commit: 9a69a44
- Added serviceTickets to useTickets() destructuring to get in-service tickets
- Created handleQuickCheckout callback that:
  1. Finds staff member by numeric ID (handles string/number conversion)
  2. Finds the staff's in-service ticket by matching techId/staffId/assignedTo.id
  3. Converts UITicket to TicketData format for the checkout panel
  4. Opens the ticket panel with openTicketWithData()
- Passed onQuickCheckout callback to StaffCardVertical component
- Quick Checkout only visible when staff is busy AND has activeTicket (existing StaffCardVertical logic)
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - UITicket uses `number` (not ticketNumber), `service` (singular string), `checkoutServices` (detailed array)
  - useTickets() returns `serviceTickets` for in-service tickets
  - openTicketWithData() accepts TicketData and stores in localStorage for TicketPanel to load
  - Staff can be matched by techId, staffId, or assignedTo.id fields on the ticket

## 2026-01-13 - US-007: Apply FrontDeskSettings to MobileTeamSection
Commit: 4c147ad
- Added useAppSelector import and read FrontDeskSettings from Redux
- Implemented organizeBy setting to control grouping: busyStatus shows Ready/Busy, clockedStatus shows Clocked In/Out
- Updated filter state type to include clockedIn/clockedOut options
- Added clockedIn/clockedOut counts to the counts calculation
- Updated filteredStaff logic to handle both organizeBy modes
- Updated groupedStaff to include clockedIn/clockedOut groups
- Updated currentCount to handle both organizeBy modes
- Filter buttons now show different options based on organizeBy (Ready/Busy vs In/Out)
- Added displayConfig to all StaffCardVertical components with settings:
  - showTurnCount, showNextAppointment, showServicedAmount (showSalesAmount), showTicketCount, showLastDone
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/MobileTeamSection.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MobileTeamSection uses a simpler 3-column filter layout (All + 2 status filters)
  - Filter state should include all possible filter values across both modes
  - useMemo should include all dependencies (organizeBy was added as dependency)
  - The desktop StaffSidebar pattern was used as reference for settings integration

## 2026-01-13 - US-008: Connect StaffCard to real ticket data
Commit: 35b6c98
- Added selectServiceTickets selector import from uiTicketsSlice
- Added inServiceTickets state from Redux using useAppSelector
- Created getStaffTicketInfo helper function (useCallback memoized) that:
  1. Filters inServiceTickets by staff ID (matches techId or assignedTo.id)
  2. Calculates real progress from createdAt time vs duration string
  3. Formats start time for display (e.g., "10:15AM")
  4. Returns activeTickets array and currentTicketInfo object
- Replaced hardcoded dummy ticket data (Test Client, Test Service, 67% progress)
- Staff cards now show real client name, service name, start time, and calculated progress
- Removed mock lastServiceTime and nextAppointmentTime (will be real data in US-009)
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - selectServiceTickets from uiTicketsSlice returns UITicket[] for in-service tickets
  - UITicket has: techId, assignedTo?.id, clientName, service, duration, createdAt
  - Duration is stored as string like "30min" - parse with parseInt(duration.replace(/\D/g, ''))
  - Progress calculation: elapsed time / total duration, capped 0-1
  - Use useCallback with [inServiceTickets] dependency for performance
  - Type compatibility: use `?? undefined` to convert null to undefined

## 2026-01-14 - US-009: Connect StaffCard to real appointment data
Commit: 11cd707
- Added selectAllAppointments selector import from appointmentsSlice
- Added selectCompletedTickets selector import from uiTicketsSlice
- Added LocalAppointment type import from @/types/appointment
- Created getStaffNextAppointment helper function (useCallback memoized) that:
  1. Filters allAppointments by staffId matching (handles string/number IDs)
  2. Only includes scheduled/confirmed/pending status appointments
  3. Filters for future appointments only
  4. Sorts by scheduledStartTime ascending
  5. Returns formatted time string (e.g., "10:30 AM")
- Created getStaffLastServiceTime helper function (useCallback memoized) that:
  1. Filters completedTickets by techId or assignedTo.id matching
  2. Sorts by updatedAt/createdAt descending (most recent first)
  3. Returns formatted time string from last completion
- Replaced mock nextAppointmentTime/lastServiceTime with real data
- Updated tooltip to show Next Appt and Last Done times
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - LocalAppointment.scheduledStartTime is always a string (ISO format) - no need for type check
  - Appointment status values: 'scheduled', 'confirmed', 'pending', 'cancelled', 'completed', etc.
  - completedTickets are tickets with status 'paid' (not 'completed' which means pending checkout)
  - UITicket.updatedAt is when ticket was marked as paid/completed
  - toLocaleTimeString with hour12: true gives "10:30 AM" format

## 2026-01-14 - US-010: Add staff card click handler for details
Commit: 5610310
- Created StaffDetailsPanel component (apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffDetailsPanel.tsx)
  - Side panel with slide-in animation and backdrop
  - Shows today's stats (tickets completed, pending appointments, total services)
  - Lists current in-service tickets for the staff member
  - Shows upcoming appointments with service name and time
  - Includes quick action buttons (Add Ticket, Add Note, Edit Team)
- Added state management in StaffSidebar: showStaffDetails, selectedStaffForDetails
- Created handleStaffClick callback that opens the details panel
- Connected onClick to StaffCardVertical component
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffDetailsPanel.tsx (new)
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/StaffSidebar.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - LocalAppointment has a `services` array of AppointmentService[], not individual serviceName/duration fields
  - Access service data via `apt.services?.[0]?.serviceName` and `apt.services?.reduce()` for duration
  - Staff details panel should reuse existing action handlers (handleAddTicket, handleAddNote, etc.)
  - Use z-50 for modal overlays to ensure proper stacking over other UI elements

## 2026-01-14 - US-011: Add Mobile staff card actions
Commit: 3d9c52d
- Created MobileStaffActionSheet component (apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/MobileStaffActionSheet.tsx)
  - Uses Radix UI Sheet component with side="bottom" for mobile-friendly bottom sheet pattern
  - Large touch targets (48px minimum) with icon + label + description for each action
  - Actions: Add Ticket, Add Note, Edit Team Member, Quick Checkout (conditional on busy status)
  - Integrated haptics for feedback on interactions
- Added state management in MobileTeamSection: showActionSheet, selectedStaffForAction, showStaffNoteModal, selectedStaffForNote
- Created action handlers matching desktop StaffSidebar pattern:
  - handleStaffCardClick: Opens action sheet with staff context
  - handleAddTicket: Opens ticket panel with staff pre-selected
  - handleAddNote: Opens AddStaffNoteModal for staff notes
  - handleEditTeam: Navigates to team-settings with staff pre-selected
  - handleQuickCheckout: Opens ticket panel with staff's current ticket
- Updated all StaffCardVertical instances to:
  - Call handleStaffCardClick on tap
  - Pass displayConfig with action settings from FrontDeskSettings
  - Pass action callbacks (onAddTicket, onAddNote, onEditTeam, onQuickCheckout)
- Files changed:
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/MobileStaffActionSheet.tsx (new)
  - apps/store-app/src/components/frontdesk/MobileTeamSection.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Sheet component with side="bottom" for mobile action sheets (better UX than dropdown)
  - Mobile components need useTicketPanel and useAppDispatch same as desktop
  - convertToStaffMember helper creates StaffMember objects - use this before passing to callbacks
  - Action handlers should be extracted to shared hooks if they're duplicated across desktop/mobile
  - Pre-existing typecheck errors in test files don't block implementation commits
