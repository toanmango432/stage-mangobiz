## Codebase Patterns

See patterns.md for accumulated patterns from previous runs.

**Front Desk Module Patterns:**
- StaffCardVertical is the shared component for mobile/desktop staff display
- frontDeskSettingsSlice controls all Front Desk settings (view modes, sorting, drag-drop)
- urgencyUtils.ts contains threshold configs and color mappings
- Use design tokens from @/design-system for all colors
- Ticket cards use ServiceTicketCard and variants (WaitListTicketCard, PendingTicketCard)
- Section headers use CollapsibleSection pattern with count badges
