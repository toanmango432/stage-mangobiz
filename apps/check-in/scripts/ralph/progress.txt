Stories: 24 (Phase 0-3: Design, Integration, Features, Quality)

## Codebase Patterns

> Reusable patterns discovered during implementation. Add general learnings here.

- Use dataService for all data operations, never Supabase directly
- Redux thunks go in src/store/slices/
- Design tokens in src/design-system/
- MQTT provider implemented locally in src/providers/MqttProvider.tsx (standalone, not using @mango/mqtt)
- Components follow pattern: src/components/[ComponentName]/index.tsx
- Types are in src/types/index.ts
- Use Zod for form validation with React Hook Form
- Touch targets must be minimum 44x44px for tablet use
- All pages are in src/pages/ directory
- Design documentation lives in docs/design/ directory
- Mango brand color is #1a5f4a (primary) and #d4a853 (secondary/accent)
- Background is warm cream #faf9f7, not pure white
- Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans for headers, Work Sans for body
- Testing: Vitest + @testing-library/react for unit/integration tests, setup in src/testing/setup.ts
- Utility functions: phone formatting, validation, etc. in src/utils/index.ts

- Created comprehensive design system documentation
- Files changed:
  - docs/design/design-system.md (color palette, typography, spacing, shadows)
  - docs/design/component-specs.md (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, icons)
  - docs/design/tablet-layouts.md (7-10" tablet layouts, screen-by-screen specs)
  - docs/design/micro-interactions.md (animations, transitions, loading states)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing pages already follow Mango design patterns (colors, fonts)
  - CSS uses inline styles with Tailwind classes, not CSS-in-JS
  - Animations defined inline with <style> blocks in components
  - Kiosk mode class prevents text selection and touch callouts

- Implemented core architecture foundation
- Files changed:
  - src/store/index.ts (Redux store with all reducers + typed hooks)
  - src/store/slices/clientSlice.ts (NEW: client state + async thunks)
  - src/store/slices/syncSlice.ts (NEW: offline sync queue state)
  - src/store/slices/index.ts (exports all slices)
  - src/services/dataService.ts (NEW: unified data access facade)
  - src/services/supabase/client.ts (NEW: Supabase client init)
  - src/services/db/database.ts (NEW: Dexie.js IndexedDB for offline)
  - src/providers/MqttProvider.tsx (NEW: MQTT context for real-time)
  - src/components/ErrorBoundary/index.tsx (NEW: error boundary)
  - src/App.tsx (refactored with Provider, ErrorBoundary, MqttProvider)
  - package.json (added @supabase/supabase-js, dexie)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The @mango/mqtt package has unresolved dependencies on parent supabase types, so check-in app uses its own lightweight MqttProvider
  - Supabase client reads from VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY env vars
  - IndexedDB tables: clients, services, technicians, checkins, syncQueue
  - All async thunks should return null (not undefined) for not-found cases
  - Error boundaries need class components (not function components)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba7ca-7a3e-7797-b4db-91456bd25518
- Implemented Phone Lookup Integration (Welcome → Verify)
- Files changed:
  - src/pages/WelcomeScreen.tsx (use formatPhone from utils instead of local)
  - src/pages/VerifyPage.tsx (replaced mock lookupClient with Redux thunk)
  - src/store/slices/clientSlice.test.ts (NEW: unit tests for thunks)
  - src/pages/VerifyPage.test.tsx (NEW: integration tests for phone lookup)
  - src/testing/setup.ts (NEW: Vitest setup with mocks)
  - vitest.config.ts (NEW: Vitest configuration)
  - package.json (added testing dependencies: vitest, @testing-library/*)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Phone formatting uses (XXX) XXX-XXXX format via src/utils/index.ts formatPhone()
  - VerifyPage handles 4 states: loading, found, not_found, error
  - Use `as never` type assertion for async thunk dispatch in tests to avoid TS errors
  - Tests pass with 21 total assertions (9 unit + 12 integration)
  - Build produces 909KB bundle - code splitting should be addressed in US-023
