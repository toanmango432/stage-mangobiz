CHECK-IN APP: PRD REVIEW & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
- ✅ ~4,500+ lines of UI code already written (65-70% complete)
- ❌ 0% backend integration
- ❌ No Redux state management
- ❌ No DataService connection
- ❌ No MQTT real-time communication
- ❌ 0% test coverage

WHAT'S ALREADY BUILT:
✅ Page routing (10 screens)
✅ UI components (forms, buttons, icons)
✅ Welcome/Verify/Signup flows
✅ Service & Technician selection
✅ Guest check-in UI
✅ Confirmation screens
✅ Configuration types

WHAT'S MISSING (Critical Path):
🔴 Redux store setup
🔴 DataService layer (API facade)
🔴 Supabase client integration
🔴 MQTT client (real-time to Store App)
🔴 Authentication/org context
🔴 IndexedDB offline storage
🟡 Error handling & loading states
🟡 Security hardening
🟡 Testing (0% coverage)
🟡 Analytics/tracking
🟡 Accessibility (WCAG)
🟡 Performance optimization

CRITICAL ISSUE:
The app is UI-only right now. It won't actually work until:
1. Redux is setup (state management)
2. DataService connects to Supabase (API)
3. Pages wire to Redux thunks (integration)
4. MQTT publishes to Store App (real-time)

RECOMMENDATION: TWO-PHASE APPROACH
────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 1 (Do with Amp, not Ralph):
  ⏱️  ~1 day
  Setup Foundation:
  - Redux store + slices
  - DataService facade
  - Supabase client
  - MQTT client
  - Error boundaries
  - Environment validation

PHASE 2 (Ralph - 18 Stories):
  ⏱️  ~3-4 weeks
  
  Tier 1 Integration (5 stories):
  - Wire pages to DataService
  - Phone lookup integration
  - Client creation
  - Service catalog fetch
  - Check-in creation
  
  Tier 2 Real-time (3 stories):
  - MQTT queue updates
  - Client called handler
  - Offline sync queue
  
  Tier 3 Features (5 stories):
  - Guest check-in
  - QR appointment lookup
  - SMS notifications
  - Admin mode
  - Analytics
  
  Tier 4 Quality (5 stories):
  - Accessibility
  - Security
  - Testing (70%)
  - E2E tests
  - Performance

EFFORT BREAKDOWN:
- Existing code: ~4,500 LOC ✅
- Phase 1 (Foundation): ~300-400 LOC (Amp)
- Phase 2 (Ralph): ~2,500-3,000 LOC (18 stories)
- Total: ~7,000-8,000 LOC production app

TIMELINE:
Week 1: Foundation (Amp)
Week 2: Integration (Ralph, Stories 1-5)
Week 3: Real-time (Ralph, Stories 6-8)
Week 4: Features (Ralph, Stories 9-13)
Week 5: Quality (Ralph, Stories 14-18)
Week 6: Production validation & deployment

PRODUCTION CHECKLIST:
✅ Security (credentials, validation, rate limiting)
✅ Data & Sync (offline, conflicts, consistency)
✅ Performance (bundle < 500KB, load < 2s)
✅ Reliability (error handling, retries, logging)
✅ Testing (70% coverage, E2E, accessibility)
✅ Monitoring (analytics, error tracking, metrics)
✅ Operations (deployment, rollback, feature flags)

APPROVAL NEEDED FOR:
1. Phase 1 approach (Foundation with Amp)
2. Revised Ralph PRD (18 stories in 4 tiers)
3. Production checklist & monitoring plan
