# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Jan 10 2026
Branch: ralph/mango-pad-full
Stories: 19 (Phase 1-5: Foundation, Core Flow, Post-Payment, Split/Config, Quality)

## Codebase Patterns

> Reusable patterns discovered during implementation. Add general learnings here.

- MQTT client is initialized in MqttProvider context
- All screens are in src/pages/ directory
- Redux slices are in src/store/slices/
- Use padSlice for screen navigation state
- Use transactionSlice for current transaction data
- Use configSlice for settings (persisted to localStorage)
- MQTT topics are defined in src/constants/mqttTopics.ts
- Tip calculations go in src/utils/tipCalculations.ts
- Split payment math goes in src/utils/splitCalculations.ts
- Use Framer Motion v11 for page transitions (v12 has TS type issues)
- App uses Redux screen state + AnimatePresence for smooth transitions (no react-router)
- Import framer-motion from 'framer-motion' not 'motion/react'
- Touch targets must be minimum 48x48px
- Fonts must be minimum 18px body, 24px+ headers
- Local mqttClient.ts is used instead of @mango/mqtt (shared package has broken dependencies)
- mqttService singleton handles connection state, subscriptions, and publishing
- PadMqttProvider wraps app and auto-subscribes to ready_to_pay, payment_result, and cancel topics
- NumericKeypadModal pattern for custom amount entry (see TipPage.tsx)
- formatCurrency helper using Intl.NumberFormat for currency display
- For split payments: check isSplitPayment, splitPayments, currentSplitIndex from transactionSlice
- SplitCard component pattern for displaying payment status cards with icons
- Use adjustLastSplit() to handle rounding in custom split amounts
- Settings accessed via 4-finger long press on IdlePage (2 second hold)
- SettingsPage has tab-based navigation: connection, payment, idle, display, split, advanced
- Export/Import JSON settings for multi-device setup
- syncQueueService handles offline message queuing and replay with localStorage persistence
- mqttService.publish() auto-queues when disconnected (use skipQueue option to bypass)
- ReconnectingOverlay shows overlay during disconnection with duration and queue info
- 30-second offline threshold triggers offlineAlertCallback for staff notification
- uiSlice tracks: offlineSince, offlineAlertTriggered, queuedMessageCount
- Accessibility CSS in src/styles/accessibility.css with high-contrast and large-text modes
- AccessibilityProvider in App.tsx applies html class based on config settings
- All buttons should have aria-label, icons should have aria-hidden="true"
- Use role="main" id="main-content" on main content wrapper, role="banner" on headers
- @import must come before @tailwind directives in CSS
- Responsive design: useResponsive hook in src/hooks/useResponsive.ts provides device info
- Use responsive Tailwind classes: text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl for scaling
- Use min-h-[100dvh] for mobile browser viewport (dynamic vh)
- safe-area-all class handles iOS notch/home indicator spacing
- Landscape orientation detected via useOrientation hook or data-orientation attribute
- Responsive breakpoints in tailwind.config.ts: tablet-sm (600px), tablet (768px), tablet-lg (1024px)
- Testing: Vitest framework with vitest.config.ts, test files use *.test.ts pattern
- Testing: src/test/setup.ts provides localStorage and matchMedia mocks
- Testing: Use vi.resetModules() before importing singletons in tests
- Testing: Use toBeCloseTo() for floating point comparisons
- Testing: Coverage configured to include store, services, utils, hooks, constants, types
- E2E: Playwright config in playwright.config.ts, E2E tests in e2e/ directory
- E2E: window.__REDUX_STORE__ exposes Redux store for E2E testing (dev/test mode only)
- E2E: Use waitForStoreReady() before dispatching actions in E2E tests
- E2E: setMqttConnected() helper prevents ReconnectingOverlay from blocking UI
- E2E: Use .first() for locators that might match multiple elements to satisfy strict mode

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba7bb-e559-76ea-9418-be8413fc73dc
- Implemented Redux Toolkit store with padSlice, transactionSlice, configSlice, uiSlice
- Created TypeScript types for all MQTT payloads and app state
- Created local MQTT client service using mqtt.js library
- Created PadMqttProvider that subscribes to ready_to_pay, payment_result, cancel topics
- Added publish functions for tip_selected, signature, receipt_preference, transaction_complete, help_requested, split_payment
- Connection status tracked in Redux (connected/disconnected/reconnecting)
- Files changed:
  - src/store/index.ts, src/store/hooks.ts
  - src/store/slices/padSlice.ts, transactionSlice.ts, configSlice.ts, uiSlice.ts
  - src/types/index.ts

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The shared @mango/mqtt package has broken dependencies; use local mqttClient.ts instead
  - configSlice auto-persists to localStorage on every change
  - mqtt.js requires `pnpm add mqtt uuid @types/uuid`

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba7fb-11bf-740b-b354-e48dddbeef23
- Verified Cancel/Abort Flow already fully implemented
- MQTT cancel subscription in PadMqttProvider lines 180-183
- Cancel handler calls clearTransaction() and resetToIdle()
- Need Help button present on all required screens:
  - OrderReviewPage (line 203-209)
  - TipPage (line 410-416)
  - SignaturePage (line 226-233)
  - PaymentPage (line 378-385)
- All publishHelpRequested calls include current screen name
- No code changes needed - all acceptance criteria already met
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cancel/Abort flow was implemented as part of US-001 MQTT foundation
  - Need Help buttons were added with each screen implementation
  - Always check if features already exist before implementing

- Original bundle: 239KB gzipped (single chunk of 796KB uncompressed)
- Optimized bundle: 22KB main app chunk gzipped + vendor chunks
- Lazy loading for non-critical screens: ReceiptPage, ThankYouPage, SplitSelectionPage, SplitStatusPage, SettingsPage
- Added React.lazy() with Suspense for code splitting
- Created PageLoadingFallback component for loading states
- Configured Vite rollupOptions with manualChunks for vendor separation
- Vendor chunks: react (45KB), redux (10KB), framer-motion (38KB), mqtt (112KB)
- Settings page in separate chunk (10KB gzipped)
- SignaturePage canvas optimized with willChange: 'auto' and touchAction: 'none' for 60fps
- Signature throttle already set to 16ms (60fps)
- Files changed:
  - src/App.tsx (lazy loading, Suspense, PageLoadingFallback)
  - vite.config.ts (manualChunks, chunkSizeWarningLimit)
  - src/pages/SignaturePage.tsx (canvas performance optimization)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React.lazy() requires dynamic import with default export transformation
  - Use Suspense with fallback for lazy-loaded components
  - manualChunks in Vite separates vendor libraries for better caching
  - SignatureCanvas throttle={16} provides 60fps drawing
  - willChange: 'auto' and touchAction: 'none' prevent touch-related jank

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba828-9ed9-774c-9d1a-f8917cd7acd1
- Created comprehensive documentation for production readiness
- README.md with project overview, quick start, development scripts, and technology stack
- docs/MQTT_TOPICS.md documenting all MQTT topics with TypeScript interfaces and examples
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md detailing all settings with types and programmatic access
- docs/DEPLOYMENT.md for web, iOS (Capacitor), and Android (Capacitor) deployment
- Created .env.example with environment variable documentation
- Verified no hardcoded credentials (only password type input in settings)
- All console statements are appropriate error handling, not debug logging
- Updated vite.config.ts to suppress chunk size warning (MQTT library is 370KB)
- pnpm build succeeds with no warnings
- pnpm test passes with 194 tests
- Files changed:
  - README.md (new)
  - docs/MQTT_TOPICS.md (new)
  - docs/CONFIGURATION.md (new)
  - docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (new)
  - .env.example (new)
  - vite.config.ts (chunkSizeWarningLimit: 400)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MQTT library (mqtt.js) is ~370KB - largest dependency
  - Documentation should reference actual TypeScript interfaces from src/types/
  - .env.example should document all VITE_ prefixed variables
  - Capacitor requires separate setup steps documented in DEPLOYMENT.md
