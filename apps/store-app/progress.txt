Task: Add processGiftCardSales to TicketPanel checkout handler
Phase: 2
Result: ✓ PASSED
Details: CRITICAL FIX - Added processGiftCardSales function that calls giftCardDB.issueGiftCard() when checkout completes. Updated handleAddGiftCard to include giftCardCode and isPhysicalCard in metadata. Gift cards are now actually created in IndexedDB upon sale.
