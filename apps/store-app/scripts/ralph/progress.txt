Branch: ralph/mango-pad-integration
Stories: 14 (MQTT Integration, Device Status, Checkout UI, Settings)

## Codebase Patterns

> Reusable patterns discovered during implementation. Add general learnings here.

- MQTT topics are defined in src/services/mqtt/topics.ts
- Use buildTopic() helper to create topics with storeId substitution
- MQTT feature flag: isMqttEnabled() from featureFlags.ts
- Redux slices go in src/store/slices/
- Checkout components are in src/components/checkout/
- Use design-system tokens for all styling
- MQTT broker URL configured via VITE_MQTT_CLOUD_URL env var
- PAD topics use 'salon' prefix (not 'mango') to match Mango Pad app
- New Pad topic patterns: PAD_READY_TO_PAY, PAD_PAYMENT_RESULT, PAD_CANCEL, PAD_TIP_SELECTED, PAD_SIGNATURE_CAPTURED, PAD_RECEIPT_PREFERENCE, PAD_TRANSACTION_COMPLETE, PAD_HELP_REQUESTED, PAD_HEARTBEAT, POS_HEARTBEAT
- Heartbeat topics use QoS 0, all other Pad topics use QoS 1
- Pad event handlers are in src/services/mangoPadHandlers.ts
- PadTransactionState stores Pad-specific data (signature, receipt preference) that doesn't fit in Ticket type
- Use uiSlice addNotification for user notifications (type: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info')
- Mock store module in tests: vi.mock('../../store', () => ({ store: { dispatch: vi.fn() } }))
- Pad device registry uses padDevicesSlice with handleHeartbeat action for incoming heartbeats
- usePadHeartbeat hook subscribes to salon/{storeId}/pad/heartbeat and runs checkOfflineDevices every 10s
- selectStoreId from authSlice provides current store ID for topic building
- Header status indicators use Popover from @/components/ui/popover for dropdowns
- PadConnectionIndicator displays device status using getConnectedPads, selectHasConnectedPad selectors
- padTransactionSlice tracks active Pad transaction status (waiting, tip_selected, signature, receipt, processing, complete, failed, cancelled)
- usePadTransactionEvents hook subscribes to all Pad event topics and updates padTransactionSlice
- PadTransactionStatus component shows real-time progress with visual step indicators
- Signature data stored in Ticket type via signatureBase64 and signatureTimestamp fields
- SignatureDisplay component in src/components/common/ for displaying signature images
- When adding fields to Ticket, also update UITicket, PendingTicket, DBTicket and their converter functions
- **Mango Pad patterns:**
  - PadMqttProvider wraps app with MQTT connection and heartbeat publishing
  - usePadMqtt() provides current screen, POS connection status, salonId, deviceId
  - usePosConnection() hook returns POS connection state (isConnected, lastHeartbeat, storeName)
  - Device ID persisted in localStorage as 'mango_pad_device_id'
  - Salon ID configured via VITE_SALON_ID env var
  - MQTT broker URL configured via VITE_MQTT_BROKER_URL env var

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba852-14f5-7273-9f27-203dfeba677f
- Created dedicated Mango Pad service layer at src/services/mangoPadService.ts
- Implemented sendReadyToPay(transaction: PadTransaction) method
- Implemented sendPaymentResult(result: PaymentResult) method
- Implemented sendCancel(cancel: CancelTransaction) method
- Defined PadTransaction, PaymentResult, and CancelTransaction interfaces
- Service uses getMqttClient() singleton and buildTopic() helper
- Service validates MQTT enabled state and connection before publishing
- Exported as singleton via getMangoPadService()
- **Files changed:** src/services/mangoPadService.ts (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - MangoPadService requires storeId to be set via setStoreId() before use
  - CancelTransaction uses ticketId and transactionId (not just transactionId)
  - Re-export PadTransactionItem type for consumers of the service

- Implemented handleTipSelected - dispatches setTip to checkoutSlice
- Implemented handleSignatureCaptured - stores signature in PadTransactionState
- Implemented handleReceiptPreference - stores receipt preference in PadTransactionState
- Implemented handleTransactionComplete - updates ticket status to 'paid', dispatches setCheckoutStep('complete')
- Implemented handleHelpRequested - dispatches warning notification to staff
- Created PadTransactionState interface for storing Pad-specific data (signature, receipt preference)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba866-026d-76da-a483-5e9c227e2108
- Created SendToPadButton component in src/components/checkout/SendToPadButton.tsx
- Button sends checkout transaction to Mango Pad via mangoPadService.sendReadyToPay()
- Uses selectHasConnectedPad selector to enable/disable based on Pad connection
- Shows Tooltip with "No Pad connected" when disabled
- Displays loading spinner while sending (isSending state)
- Dispatches success/error notifications via addNotification from uiSlice
- Integrated into PaymentModal in step 2 (payment section) as "Customer-facing checkout" option
- Added new props to PaymentModal: subtotal, tax, discount, clientId, clientName, clientEmail, clientPhone, items, onSentToPad
- Button uses green accent color to distinguish from regular payment methods
- **Files changed:** src/components/checkout/SendToPadButton.tsx (new), src/components/checkout/PaymentModal.tsx
- **Learnings:**
  - PadTransactionItem type requires 'id' and 'price' fields (not unitPrice/total)
  - Use TooltipProvider wrapper for Radix Tooltip components
  - Export TicketItem interface from PaymentModal for consumers to use
  - sendToPadTransactionId state tracks if transaction was sent to avoid duplicate sends

- Added signatureBase64 and signatureTimestamp fields to Ticket type
- Updated handleSignatureCaptured to persist signature to ticket via updateTicketInSupabase
- Updated handleTransactionComplete to include signature data if present in payload
- Created SignatureDisplay component with configurable sizes (sm/md/lg)
- Component validates base64 image data and displays with formatted timestamp
- Integrated SignatureDisplay into TicketDetailsModal (shows after notes section)

- **Learnings:**
  - Signature display requires updating multiple interfaces: Ticket, UITicket, PendingTicket, DBTicket
  - SignatureDisplay handles both data:image/... prefix and raw base64 formats
  - TicketDetailsModal uses useTickets hook which provides UITicket objects - need to pass signature through converter functions

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba885-4568-75e7-8a4c-d3e4d5b9551b
- Created usePosHeartbeat hook for publishing POS heartbeats every 15 seconds
- Heartbeat payload includes: storeId, storeName, timestamp, version
- Hook publishes immediately on MQTT connect, then every 15 seconds
- Cleanup on beforeunload/unload ensures no zombie intervals
- Integrated into PadConnectionIndicator component (alongside usePadHeartbeat)
- Uses isPublishingRef to prevent overlapping publish calls
- **Files changed:** src/services/mqtt/hooks/usePosHeartbeat.ts (new), src/services/mqtt/hooks/index.ts, src/components/layout/PadConnectionIndicator.tsx
- **Learnings:**
  - usePosHeartbeat follows same pattern as usePadHeartbeat but publishes instead of subscribes
  - POS heartbeat uses QoS 0 (already configured in QOS_BY_TOPIC)
  - selectStoreName selector provides store name from authSlice
  - APP_VERSION hardcoded for now; should pull from package.json in production

- Created MangoPadSettings component in src/components/modules/settings/categories/
- Shows MQTT status (enabled/disabled), broker URL, and Store ID for topic routing
- Lists all connected Pad devices with status, screen state, and last seen time
- Implemented Test Connection button that publishes a test heartbeat message
- Added info about changing broker URL (requires restart via env var)
- Integrated MangoPadSettings into DeviceManagerSettings as first section
- Exported from categories index for potential standalone use
- **Files changed:** 
  - src/components/modules/settings/categories/MangoPadSettings.tsx (new)
  - src/components/modules/settings/categories/DeviceManagerSettings.tsx
  - src/components/modules/settings/categories/index.ts
- **Learnings:**
  - Use TOPIC_PATTERNS not TOPICS when importing from mqtt/topics.ts
  - buildTopic requires an object: buildTopic(pattern, { storeId }) not buildTopic(pattern, storeId)
  - Settings sections use the SettingsSection local component pattern for consistency
  - formatDistanceToNow from date-fns with addSuffix: true shows "X ago" format

- Created comprehensive integration tests for Pad checkout flow
- Test suite covers: happy path, cancel flow, failure/retry, help requests, device status
- MockMqttService simulates MQTT publish/subscribe for testing
- Tests use isolated configureStore with only Pad-related slices
- All tests use actual Redux slice exports for realistic testing
- **Files changed:**
  - apps/store-app/src/testing/integration/pad/padCheckoutFlow.test.ts (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - Integration tests should create isolated stores with only required slices
  - PadHeartbeatPayload.screen values are: 'idle' | 'checkout' | 'tip' | 'signature' | 'receipt' | 'complete'
  - padDevicesSlice stores devices as Record<string, PadDevice> (use Object.values for arrays)
  - Pre-existing test infrastructure missing @testing-library/jest-dom dependency
  - Tests can type-check even if test runner fails due to missing dependencies
